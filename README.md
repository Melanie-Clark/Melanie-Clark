# 👋 Hi, I'm Mel! 👋 
⚡ **Backend Developer | Python, SQL, PHP, APIs | Clinical Systems & Data Solutions**

## ❔ **Who Am I** ❔

After 20 years of developing and leading clinical systems solutions and projects, I've taken the leap and started the transition into software development, with a focus on backend technologies.

I've always loved geeking out and learning to code (shoutout to my Codecademy days!), but things really leveled up when I completed the **Code First Girls** Software Engineering nanodegree with Distinction. Since then, I've been having fun designing and building a mix of personal and group projects and continue to expand my knowledge and experience.

My background in managing clinical systems projects has evidenced effective problem-solving, solid exposure of the SDLC, and embedded the importance of building reliable, user-friendly solutions. Give me a bug to fix or a problem to solve and I'll be there! 😄
