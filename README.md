# 👋 Hi, I'm Mel! 👋 
⚡ Junior Software Developer | Python, SQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin, RESTful APIs, HTML, CSS, Wordpress, Selenium |\
_Passionate about building scalable and efficient solutions with a background in clinical systems & healthcare solutions_

## ❔ **Who Am I** ❔

After 20 years of developing and leading clinical systems solutions and projects, I've taken the leap and started the transition into software development, with a focus on backend technologies.

I've always loved geeking out and learning to code (shoutout to my Codecademy days!), but things really levelled up when I completed the **Code First Girls Software Engineering** nanodegree with Distinction. Since then, I've been having fun designing and building a mix of personal and group projects and continue to expand my knowledge and experience.

My background in managing clinical systems projects  demonstrates effective problem-solving, teamwork, understanding of the SDLC and the importance of building robust user-friendly solutions.

I typically find myself in the role where people look to me for support and guidance or help to fix a problem. Give me a bug to fix or a problem to solve and I'll be there ready to geek out and feeling super excited inside! 😄
