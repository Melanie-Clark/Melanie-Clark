# 👋 Hi, I'm Mel! 👋 
⚡ **Backend Developer | Python, SQL, PHP, APIs | Clinical Systems & Data Solutions**

## ❔ **Who Am I** ❔

With 20 years of experience as a Clinical System Project Lead and Specialist, I’m excited transitioning into software development, with a focus on backend technologies.

I've always loved geeking out and learning to code and over the years have dabbled in the likes of Codecademy. However, after graduating from the **Code First Girls Software Engineering** nanodegree, earning a Distinction, I took the opportunity to push myself to be creative designing & developing projects, both personal and group.

My background in managing clinical systems projects has evidenced effective problem-solving, solid exposure of the SDLC, and embedded the importance of building reliable, user-friendly solutions.
